# Useful resources for beginners to k8s

### What is kubernetes (k8s) and why is it so cool?

[This is a comic from Google](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/kubernetes-comic/) that does a great job of explaining why kubernetes matters and why you should be excited to learn about it.

And [this is my favourite video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ht22ReBjno) that does a great job of introducing some basic k8s concepts

### Videos and references for beginners

There are a lot of great references and videos all over the web, here is a collection I've gone through that I feel does a really good job of explaining some of the basic concepts.
NOTE: I did not create this content, I am simply sharing.
